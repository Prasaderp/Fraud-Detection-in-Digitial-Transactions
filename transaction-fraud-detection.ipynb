From the distribution of amount we understood that we have a lot of outliers with high amount in transactions. Hence we consider the 75th percentile(450k) as our threshold and amount which is greater than 450k will be triggered as a flag\n",

When there is a receiver who receives money from a lot of people, it could be a trigger as it can be for some illegal games of chance or luck. Hence it is flagged when there is a receiver who receives money for more than 20 times.\n",
